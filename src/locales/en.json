The profiles display site-level information collected by REACH, NRC and PRMN with the overall objective of strengthening the predictability and effectiveness of multi-sectorial interventions at site level and/or within areas of concentrated sites. Information is collected through key informants at each IDP site; figures are to be taken as indicative. As of January 2018, the DSA covered 1,751 sites in 22 districts. For further information visit the Somalia CCCM Cluster Web Portal or to provide feedback, kindly email cluster coordination (ilyas@unhcr.org and kziga@iom.int).",
